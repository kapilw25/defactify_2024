World Bank's Revised Global Economy Forecast

The World Bank has revised its forecast for the global economy, projecting a rosier growth outlook for this year, with global growth expected to hold steady at 2.6 percent, an upgrade from its previous forecast of 2.4 percent in January. However, the bank warns that the rise of new trade barriers and protectionist policies poses a long-term threat to global growth. The latest Global Economic Prospects report indicates that the global economy is stabilizing after being rocked by the pandemic, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and inflation.

According to the report, the U.S. economy's resilience has led to the slightly brighter forecast, with advanced economies growing at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, while output remains sluggish in Europe and Japan. By contrast, emerging market and developing economies are growing at a rate of 4 percent, led by China and Indonesia. However, sluggish growth continues to plague the world's poorest economies, which are still grappling with inflation and high debt burdens.

The bank notes that over the next three years, countries that account for more than 80 percent of the world's population will experience slower growth than in the decade before the pandemic. Despite the stronger growth forecast, the World Bank says that prices are easing more slowly than it projected six months ago, with global inflation expected to moderate to 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.9 percent next year. This gradual decline is likely to lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts, dimming prospects for growth in developing economies.

In summary, while the World Bank's latest report forecasts a rosier outlook for global growth this year, the rise of new trade barriers and protectionist policies pose a long-term threat to global output. The report highlights the resilience of the U.S. economy, the sluggish growth in Europe and Japan, and the faster growth in emerging market and developing economies, led by China and Indonesia.

By Alan Rappeport, Reporting from Washington 

The World Bank on Tuesday raised its outlook for the world economy this year but warned that the rise of new trade barriers and protectionist policies posed a long-term threat to global growth. 

In its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank projected global growth to hold steady at 2.6 percent this year, an upgrade from its January forecast of 2.4 percent, and predicted that output would edge higher to 2.7 percent in 2025. 

The forecasts showed the global economy stabilizing after being rocked in recent years by the pandemic and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. 

“Four years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,"" Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist, said in a statement accompanying the report. 

However, sluggish growth continues to haunt the world’s poorest economies, which are still grappling with inflation and the burdens of high debt. 

The bank noted that over the next three years, countries that account for more than 80 percent of the world’s population would experience slower growth than in the decade before the pandemic. 

The slightly brighter forecast was led by the resilience of the U.S. economy, which continues to defy expectations despite higher interest rates. 

Overall, advanced economies are growing at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, with output remaining sluggish in Europe and Japan. 

By contrast, emerging market and developing economies are growing at a rate of 4 percent, led by China and Indonesia. 

Although growth is expected to be a bit stronger than previously forecast, the World Bank said prices were easing more slowly than it projected six months ago. 

It foresees global inflation moderating to 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.9 percent next year. 

That gradual decline is likely to lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts, dimming prospects for growth in developing economies.",1221,"Global Economy Boosted by World Bank's Optimistic Growth Forecast The World Bank has revised its global economic growth forecast upward for the current year but cautioned that the proliferation of trade barriers and protectionist measures could pose long-term risks to the world's output. In its recent Global Economic Prospects report, the bank has increased its projection for global growth to 2.6 percent in 2023, up from its previous forecast of 2.4 percent made in January, and anticipates a slight increase to 2.7 percent by 2025. This outlook reflects a stabilization of the global economy following the turbulence caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary policy tightening in recent years. Indermit Gill, the World Bank's chief economist, remarked that after four years of upheaval, global economic growth appears to be stabilizing. However, the report also highlights that the world's least developed economies are still struggling with the effects of inflation and high debt levels, leading to slower growth compared to the pre-pandemic decade. The improved outlook is largely driven by the robust performance of the U.S. economy, which has shown resilience despite rising interest rates, and by the stronger-than-expected growth in advanced economies, currently expanding at an annual rate of 1.5 percent. Growth in Europe and Japan remains sluggish, while emerging market and developing economies are growing at a more robust rate of 4 percent, with China and Indonesia leading the way. Despite the more optimistic growth forecast, the World Bank notes that inflation is easing more slowly than expected, predicting a decline to 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.9 percent in 2025. This slower reduction in prices may prompt central banks to delay interest rate cuts, potentially slowing growth in developing economies."
