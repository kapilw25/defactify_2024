Historical Trends in Healthcare and COVID-19 in Bonneville County

The healthcare landscape in Bonneville County has undergone significant changes over the years. This includes trends in hospital admissions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data presented here, sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Census Bureau, has been meticulously archived and is regularly updated to reflect the most current information.

COVID-19 Guidance and Tracking in Bonneville County, Idaho

As of March 26, 2024, the New York Times has been tracking the progression of COVID-19 in Bonneville County, Idaho. Daily admissions for COVID-19 in the area are a critical metric, as they indicate the virus's impact on the community. The number of daily admissions shows how many patients were admitted to hospitals for COVID-19, which is one of the most reliable indicators of the pandemic's severity.

The data on hospitalizations is reported by individual hospitals to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It includes confirmed and suspected adult and pediatric patients. The CDC's hospitalization data is a daily average of COVID-19 patients in hospital service areas that intersect with Bonneville County, which may be larger than the county itself.

Vaccination Rates and Demographic Data

Statewide, 2% of vaccinations did not specify the home county. The primary series vaccination rate for the total population and those aged 65 and up, as well as the bivalent booster rate for the same age groups, are crucial statistics. An updated vaccine is recommended for adults and most children.

The CDC stopped reporting data on COVID-19 in 2023. However, hospitalization data is still available as a daily average of COVID-19 patients in hospital service areas that intersect with Bonneville County. It's important to note that the CDC does not provide complete vaccination data for some counties and caps its vaccination rate figures at 95 percent.

The data and insights presented here are the result of collaborative efforts by Jon Huang, Samuel Jacoby, Jasmine C. Lee, John-Michael Murphy, Charlie Smart, and Albert Sun. Their work has been instrumental in providing accurate and up-to-date information on the COVID-19 situation in Bonneville County and beyond.

**Senate Races:**

* **Georgia:** The Senate race remains extremely tight and could head to a December 6th runoff. Early returns favored Raphael Warnock, but this could be misleading. Brian Kemp received more votes than Herschel Walker across Georgia, particularly in the Atlanta area and its suburbs.
* **Nevada:**  Cortez Masto is currently leading, but a significant number of votes remain to be counted in Clark and Washoe counties.
* **Pennsylvania:** John Fetterman is ahead, outperforming Biden in several key counties.
* **Arizona:** The race is a tossup. Early voting favored Mark Kelly, but late-counted mail and in-person votes are expected to favor Blake Masters.
* **Wisconsin:** Leaning towards Johnson, but remains close.
* **Ohio:** Vance won handily, even as most of the state voted more Democratic than in 2020.
* **Overall:** Democrats and Republicans each need to win three more competitive Senate seats to gain control.  Senator Cortez Masto’s victory in Nevada secures Democratic control, even if Republicans win in Georgia.

**House Races:**

* **New York:** Republicans have won in four of five New York tossup seats, and are leading in the fifth.
* **Overall:** Republicans must win 19 competitive seats to retake majority control. As of noon Eastern on November 10th, Democrats have 190 seats, Republicans have 208, and 37 are still undecided.

* **Abortion Rights:** Voters in three states (Michigan, California, Vermont) enshrined lasting protections for abortion rights in their state constitutions.
* **Election Deniers:** Over 210 Republicans who questioned the 2020 election have won seats in the U.S. House and Senate and in state races.
* **Michigan:** Democrats outperformed Biden in Michigan, maintaining seven of their seats and appearing poised to control the State Assembly and Senate.
* **Florida:** DeSantis won by 11 percentage points, and Republicans gained ground in Hispanic counties.
* **Virginia:** Fast counting in rural counties boosted Republican candidates.
* **2020 Comparisons:**  Vance carried Ohio statewide, but with a leftward swing.

**State-Specific Updates:**

* **Arizona (Governor):** The gap between candidates narrowed after November 8th as late absentee ballots were tallied.
* **Kentucky:**  Appears to have rejected a restrictive abortion amendment.
* **Maine:** Mills of Maine was re-elected.
* **Texas:** Abbott won, but lagged in Hispanic counties.
* **Michigan (Proposal 3):** Support for the abortion rights proposal was stronger than support for the re-elected Governor Gretchen Whitmer in many counties.

The committee members expressed significant concerns over Lykos' inability to gather comprehensive data from participants regarding the drug's potential for abuse. MDMA is known for inducing feelings of euphoria and well-being.

Paul Holtzheimer, the deputy director for research at the National Center for PTSD and a panelist who voted against the therapy, acknowledged the need for new and improved treatments for PTSD. However, the panel was not convinced that the benefits of MDMA-assisted therapy outweighed the risks.

The expert panel raised questions about the clinical trial data, suggesting that the risks of the treatment for PTSD were not sufficiently outweighed by the benefits. Prior to the vote, several panel members criticized the design of the two studies conducted by the therapy's sponsor. A major point of contention was that participants could easily discern if they had been administered MDMA, also known as Ecstasy or molly.

In a 9-2 vote, the panel determined that the MDMA-assisted therapy was effective. However, in a 10-1 vote, they concluded that the therapy's benefits did not outweigh its risks. Panelists were particularly worried about the drug's potential cardiovascular effects and the possibility of bias among the therapists and facilitators, which may have skewed patient outcomes positively. The panel was also troubled by an instance of misconduct involving a patient and therapist during the study.",745," The independent advisory panel of the FDA rejected the use of MDMA-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder on Tuesday, citing the unparalleled regulatory challenges associated with a novel therapy using the drug commonly known as Ecstasy.

Paul Holtzheimer, the deputy director for clinical research at the National Center for PTSD, who was a panelist who voted no on the question of whether the benefits of MDMA-therapy outweighed the risks, expressed his agreement that new and better treatments for PTSD are needed. However, he raised concerns about the designs of the two studies by the sponsor, which he believed did not provide enough data to support the effectiveness of the therapy.

Many questions focused on the fact that study participants were able to guess they had been given MDMA, also known as Ecstasy or molly. The panel voted 9-2 on whether the MDMA-assisted therapy was effective, voted 10-1 on whether the proposed benefits outweighed the risks, and expressed concerns over the drug's potential cardiovascular effects and possible bias among the therapists and facilitators who guided the sessions.

A case of misconduct involving a patient and therapist in the study also weighed on panelists' minds.
