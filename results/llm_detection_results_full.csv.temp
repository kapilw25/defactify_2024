Read our review of ""Prairie Fires"" by Metropolitan & Company. $35

A simple conceit turns a timely novel about a couple fleeing a civil war into a profound meditation on exile. Provocatively, Alderman suggests that history's horrors are inescapable – that there will always be abuses of power, that the arc of history doesn't bend toward justice so much as inscribe a circle that moves away from it. $24.95

Doors separate the calamities of the old world from the unknown of the new, as the migrants learn how to adjust to an improvisatory existence. $27. $40.

She also brings to bear her gifts as a poet, mixing the sacred and profane in a way that's wonderfully grounded and authentic. $ (price not specified)

What is more, at a time of economic inequality, reminiscent of the 19th century's Gilded Age, and a threat from white-supremacy groups, Chernow us that Grant's courageous example is more relevant than ever, and in this, ""Grant"" is as much a commentary on our own time as a lesson."

The Schlock of the New

I'm thinking about Kevin Hassett's appearance at the Tax Policy Center, where he took advantage of his hosts' graciousness by gratuitously impugning their integrity.

And, really, brilliant innovations don't come easy. The radical views on the right get mainlined straight into policy pronouncements by the European Commission, and the leadership of the Republican Party. Nonetheless, there was one radical concept: contractionary fiscal policy is expansionary, expansionary monetary policy is actually deflationary, and terrible things happen when debt crosses 90 percent of GDP."

By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion. ""It always helped me with animals in the rescue center, and I knew that it would be easier and a little bit safer with the car,"" she said.

""So even though I was afraid of being on that beach, I went with them."" Although the group did spot a leatherback turtle, that was the end of their good luck. Amador said she hesitantly agreed to drive the group back to the rescue center, stopped at an obstacle in the road, and was overtaken by a group of masked men.

Brave Testimony Helps Convict Costa Rican Slayers of a Turtle Conservationist

Updated, 6:51 p.m. | There is seemingly no end to the violence against environmentalists and community-rights campaigners on the world's loosely-governed resource frontiers. The murder last month of Berta Cáceres, a much-lauded Honduran indigenous activist, was just the most prominent recent example.

They threw Jairo in the backseat with other volunteers. He had been working as a veterinarian at the Costa Rican Wildlife Sanctuary on a beach just outside Limón at the time of Mora's murder on May 30, 2013. Three other men were acquitted.

Let's hope that, at the very least, Jairo Mora's death and the bravery of Almudena Amador lead to lasting changes in Costa Rica's justice system — and perhaps eventually to safer conditions for both turtles and their defenders on that nation's beautiful, but troubled, beaches."

What's Next About Ross Douthat joined The New York Times as an Op-Ed columnist in April 2009. 

Part of what ""Submission"" does is to portray a Europe that is more violent, closer to internal civil war than the real continent; in that way the novel shrinks the huge gulf that separates Western stability and prosperity from the ongoing agonies of the Islamic Middle East. 

But it's noteworthy that while Houellebecq only needs to exaggerate reality to make our own society seem ripe for some sort of submission, he needs to turn to a pure fantasy - one that's not even detailed enough to be described as Orientalist - in order to envision how that submission might actually be imposed or brought about. 

You don't have to share the author's dark view of late modernity to at least recognize the European society that he's mocking, the types he's ridiculing (including himself), the kind of decadence that he portrays as the West's essential lot. 

The novel might promise peace and harmony, but Houellebecq seems to have little idea what that religion looked like in practice and what sacrifices it would entail."

As of July 2016, Russia's Reserve Fund stood at $50.6 billion, down from $80 billion in July 2014.

Note: Crude oil prices were around $30 a barrel in February and have risen since then.

One reason for Russia's current economic situation is the decline in global oil prices since June. 

According to Kimberly Marten, a scholar at Barnard College and Columbia University, ""Russia's economy never diversified away from oil and raw materials export dependence.""

Why Bernie Can't Win

Over the summer, while discussing how Hillary Clinton's rivals might press their case against her, I argued that the biggest problem for her would-be challengers is that their strongest remaining critique, now that she's moved leftward, is one that Democratic primary voters simply may not want to hear:

[On issues], at last, the anti-Hillary argument becomes an easy one: From the Nixonian style of her State Department operation to the way her family fattened itself on global tribute during her recent public service, her rivals can point to sins and misdemeanors that would have already disqualified a lesser candidate."

BookClub: 'Passing' By Nella Larsen

For the third installment of T Book Club, we're reading Nella Larsen's ""Passing"" (1929), in which two old friends, both Black women, reunite in 1920s Harlem, with the fact that one of them is living as a white person. Here is some reading to help do the same.

Time and again, he has been forced to live under cruel and impossible terms as determined by white society, and as a result, has seen his hopes dashed and his humanity dismissed — ""I am,"" he proclaims, ""invisible because people refuse to see me"" — even as he moves toward a greater understanding of his situation."
