    Global Economy Global Economy Supported by World Bank Sees Rosier Growth Outlook But rising trade barriers pose a long-term threat to global output as protectionist policies spread, the bank said. ByAlan Rappeport Reporting from Washington The World Bank on Tuesday raised its outlook for the world economy this year but warned that the rise of new trade barriers and protectionist policies posed a long-term threat to global growth. In its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank projected global growth to hold steady at 2.6 percent this year, an upgrade from itsJanuary forecastof 2.4 percent, and predicted that output would edge higher to 2.7 percent in 2025. The forecasts showed the global economy stabilizing after being rocked in recent years by the pandemic and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. ""Four years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,"" Indermit Gill, the World Bank's chief economist, said in a statement accompanying the report. However, sluggish growth continues to haunt the world's poorest economies, which are still grappling with inflation and the burdens of high debt. The bank noted that over the next three years, countries that account for more than 80 percent of the world's population would experience slower growth than in the decade before the pandemic. The slightly brighter forecast was led by the resilience of the U.S. economy, which continues to defy expectations despite higher interest rates. Overall, advanced economies are growing at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, with output remaining sluggish in Europe and Japan. By contrast, emerging market and developing economies are growing at a rate of 4 percent, led by China and Indonesia. Although growth is expected to be a bit stronger than previously forecast, the World Bank said prices were easing more slowly than it projected six months ago. It foresees global inflation moderating to 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.9 percent next year. That gradual decline is likely to lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts, dimming prospects for growth in developing economies.
    ",meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo,1089,"In its recent Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank has revised its forecast for global economic growth this year, projecting it to remain steady at 2.6%, an improvement from the previous prediction of 2.4% in January. The report, however, also highlights the looming threat of rising trade barriers and protectionist policies, which could jeopardize long-term global output. According to the bank, the global economy is showing signs of stabilization after being severely impacted by the pandemic, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and inflation.

The report's chief economist, Indermit Gill, stated that despite the challenges of the past four years, global economic growth appears to be steadying. However, the world's poorest economies continue to struggle with sluggish growth, high inflation, and the burden of debt. The bank predicts that over the next three years, more than 80% of the world's population will experience slower growth than in the decade preceding the pandemic.

The improved forecast is largely attributed to the resilience of the U.S. economy, which has defied expectations despite higher interest rates. Advanced economies are growing at an annual rate of 1.5%, with Europe and Japan experiencing sluggish output. In contrast, emerging market and developing economies are growing at a rate of 4%, driven by China and Indonesia. 

Although growth is expected to be slightly stronger than previously forecast, the World Bank notes that inflation is easing more slowly than anticipated six months ago. The bank expects global inflation to moderate to 3.5% in 2024 and 2.9% next year. This gradual decline may lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts, potentially dampening growth prospects in developing economies.",1244," The global economy is projected to see steady growth this year and next, according to the World Bank.

The World Bank has raised its outlook for the world economy this year, but a warning has been issued about the long-term threat to global output due to the increasing trade barriers and protectionist policies spreading across the globe. 

Reporting from Washington, The World Bank on Tuesday upgraded its forecast for the global economy this year. According to its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank predicted that global growth will hold steady at 2.6 percent this year, an improvement from its January forecast of 2.4 percent. The bank also forecasted that the global output will edge higher to 2.7 percent in 2025. 

The global economy seems to be stabilizing after facing significant challenges in the recent years due to the pandemic and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. ""Four years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,"" said Indermit Gill, the World Bank's chief economist in a statement accompanying the report.

However, the world's poorest economies are still facing sluggish growth, which is being hindered by inflation and high debt burdens. The bank noted that over the next three years, countries that account for more than 80 percent of the world's population will experience slower growth than in the decade before the pandemic.

The slightly brighter forecast is mainly due to the resilience of the U.S. economy, which continues to defy expectations despite higher interest rates. Advanced economies are growing at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, with output remaining sluggish in Europe and Japan. On the other hand, emerging market and developing economies are growing at a rate of 4 percent, led by China and Indonesia.

Although growth is expected to be a bit stronger than previously forecast, the World Bank said that prices are easing more slowly than it projected six months ago. It foresees global inflation moderating to 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.9 percent next year. The gradual decline in inflation is likely to lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts, which may dim the prospects for growth in developing economies.",1165,"Global Economy Outlook Improves According to World Bank, But Trade Barriers Remain a Concern The World Bank has revised its forecast for global economic growth this year to a more optimistic outlook, but it also highlighted the potential long-term risks posed by increasing trade barriers and protectionist policies. In its recent Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank upgraded its growth projection for 2023 to 2.6 percent, up from the 2.4 percent it anticipated in January. The bank also forecasts that global output will slightly increase to 2.7 percent by 2025. These projections indicate a stabilization of the global economy following the disruptions caused by the pandemic, conflicts, and inflationary pressures. Indermit Gill, the World Bank's chief economist, noted in a statement that after four years of turmoil, global economic growth appears to be stabilizing. However, he also pointed out that the world's least developed economies are still struggling with inflation and high levels of debt, which is causing their growth to lag. The World Bank also observed that over the next three years, countries representing more than 80 percent of the world's population are expected to see slower growth compared to the pre-pandemic decade. The improved outlook is largely driven by the resilience of the U.S. economy, which has remained robust despite rising interest rates. Advanced economies are growing at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, with slower growth in Europe and Japan. Meanwhile, emerging market and developing economies are experiencing growth rates of 4 percent, led by countries such as China and Indonesia. Although the growth outlook has improved slightly, the World Bank noted that inflation is declining more slowly than anticipated. It now expects global inflation to fall to 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.9 percent in 2025. This slower reduction in inflation could prompt central banks to delay cutting interest rates, potentially slowing growth in developing economies.",1150,"## World Bank Boosts Global Growth Forecast, Warns of Trade Barrier Risks

The World Bank has revised its global economic growth forecast upwards for this year, but cautioned that escalating trade barriers and protectionist measures represent a significant long-term threat.

Reporting from Washington, Alan Rappeport notes the bank now projects global growth of 2.6% in 2024, an increase from its January estimate of 2.4%, with a further rise to 2.7% expected in 2025. This suggests stabilization after recent disruptions caused by the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and conflict in the Middle East.

“Four years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,” stated Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist.

However, the report highlights persistent slow growth in the world’s poorest nations, still struggling with inflation and high debt levels.  Over the next three years, the World Bank predicts that countries representing over 80% of the global population will experience slower growth compared to the pre-pandemic decade.

The improved forecast is largely driven by the surprising resilience of the U.S. economy. Advanced economies are currently growing at 1.5% annually, while Europe and Japan continue to see sluggish performance. Emerging markets and developing economies are leading growth at 4%, particularly China and Indonesia.

Despite the slightly optimistic outlook, the World Bank notes that global inflation is easing more slowly than previously anticipated, projected to fall to 3.5% in 2024 and 2.9% in 2025. This slower decline may prompt central banks to postpone interest rate cuts, potentially hindering growth in developing economies.
