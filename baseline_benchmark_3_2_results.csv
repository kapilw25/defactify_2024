    Global Economy Global Economy Supported by World Bank Sees Rosier Growth Outlook But rising trade barriers pose a long-term threat to global output as protectionist policies spread, the bank said. ByAlan Rappeport Reporting from Washington The World Bank on Tuesday raised its outlook for the world economy this year but warned that the rise of new trade barriers and protectionist policies posed a long-term threat to global growth. In its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank projected global growth to hold steady at 2.6 percent this year, an upgrade from itsJanuary forecastof 2.4 percent, and predicted that output would edge higher to 2.7 percent in 2025. The forecasts showed the global economy stabilizing after being rocked in recent years by the pandemic and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. ""Four years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,"" Indermit Gill, the World Bank's chief economist, said in a statement accompanying the report. However, sluggish growth continues to haunt the world's poorest economies, which are still grappling with inflation and the burdens of high debt. The bank noted that over the next three years, countries that account for more than 80 percent of the world's population would experience slower growth than in the decade before the pandemic. The slightly brighter forecast was led by the resilience of the U.S. economy, which continues to defy expectations despite higher interest rates. Overall, advanced economies are growing at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, with output remaining sluggish in Europe and Japan. By contrast, emerging market and developing economies are growing at a rate of 4 percent, led by China and Indonesia. Although growth is expected to be a bit stronger than previously forecast, the World Bank said prices were easing more slowly than it projected six months ago. It foresees global inflation moderating to 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.9 percent next year. That gradual decline is likely to lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts, dimming prospects for growth in developing economies.
    ",meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo,1331,"In its recent Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank has painted a cautiously optimistic picture of the global economy, revising its growth outlook upwards for this year. According to the report, the world economy is expected to maintain a steady growth rate of 2.6% in 2023, an improvement from the January forecast of 2.4%, and is projected to inch up to 2.7% in 2025. This positive outlook is attributed to the resilience of the US economy, which continues to perform better than expected despite the challenges of higher interest rates.

However, the bank cautioned that the long-term health of the global economy is under threat from the growing trend of protectionist policies and trade barriers. The bank's chief economist, Indermit Gill, noted that while the global economy appears to be stabilizing after the shocks of the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, the world's poorest economies are still struggling with inflation and high debt burdens. The report also highlighted that over the next three years, countries accounting for more than 80% of the world's population will experience slower growth than in the decade before the pandemic.

The report further noted that while emerging market and developing economies are growing at a rate of 4%, led by China and Indonesia, advanced economies are growing at an annual rate of 1.5%, with Europe and Japan lagging behind. The World Bank also warned that inflation is easing more slowly than previously projected, with global inflation expected to moderate to 3.5% in 2024 and 2.9% in 2025. This gradual decline is likely to result in delayed interest rate cuts by central banks, which could dampen growth prospects in developing economies.",774," The global economy is expected to see steady growth this year, according to the World Bank.

The World Bank has raised its outlook for the world economy this year, but warns that the rise of new trade barriers and protectionist policies pose a long-term threat to global growth. 

Reporting from Washington, the World Bank on Tuesday upgraded its forecast for global growth, predicting it will hold steady at 2.6 percent this year. This is an increase from its previous forecast of 2.4 percent in January. The bank also predicted that output will edge higher to 2.7 percent in 2025.

The World Bank has revised its outlook for the global economy this year, predicting a rosier growth scenario. However, it also highlighted the potential long-term threat posed by the increasing trade barriers and the spread of protectionist policies.

In its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank forecasts global growth to remain stable at 2.6 percent for 2023, marking an improvement from its previous January estimate of 2.4 percent. The projection for 2025 is an anticipated slight increase to 2.7 percent. This outlook suggests a stabilization of the global economy following the turbulence caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary policy tightening.

Indermit Gill, the World Bank's chief economist, noted in a statement that four years after the pandemic-induced upheavals, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, global economic growth appears to be stabilizing.

Despite this stabilization, the world's poorest economies continue to face challenges, particularly inflation and high debt levels. The report indicates that over the next three years, countries representing more than 80 percent of the global population will likely experience slower growth compared to the pre-pandemic decade.

The improved forecast is largely driven by the resilience of the U.S. economy, which has shown unexpected strength despite higher interest rates. Advanced economies are expected to grow at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, with Europe and Japan showing sluggish growth. In contrast, emerging market and developing economies are projected to grow at a rate of 4 percent, with China and Indonesia leading the way.

While the growth outlook is somewhat brighter, the World Bank noted that prices are easing more slowly than anticipated. Global inflation is expected to moderate to 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.9 percent in 2025. This slower decline in inflation could lead to delayed interest rate cuts by central banks, potentially dampening growth prospects in developing economies.",1562,"## World Bank Raises Global Growth Forecast, Warns of Trade Barrier Risks

The World Bank has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth in 2024 to 2.6%, a rise from its January projection of 2.4%, and anticipates a slight increase to 2.7% in 2025. This suggests the global economy is stabilizing after recent shocks from the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and conflicts in the Middle East.

According to the latest *Global Economic Prospects* report, the resilience of the U.S. economy is a key driver of this improved outlook. Advanced economies are currently growing at 1.5% annually, though Europe and Japan continue to experience sluggish growth. Emerging markets and developing economies are leading growth at 4%, fueled by China and Indonesia.

However, the World Bank cautioned that rising trade barriers and protectionist policies represent a significant long-term threat to global output.  Furthermore, while global inflation is expected to ease to 3.5% in 2024 and 2.9% in 2025, the slower-than-anticipated decline may prompt central banks to delay interest rate cuts, potentially hindering growth in developing economies.

The report also highlights that slower growth continues to impact the world’s poorest nations, who are still struggling with inflation and high debt levels.  Over the next three years, countries representing over 80% of the global population are projected to experience growth rates lower than those seen before the pandemic.
